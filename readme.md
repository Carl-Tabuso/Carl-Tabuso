Name is Carl Tabuso, a senior student at PUP Santa Rosa. Had a little background and basic knowledge on low-level languages such as C and C++ during high school, not clever enough for them (wtf you mean i have to manage memory allocation). At the same time during SHS, was introduced to various programming paradigmgs: procedural, oop, functional, dysfunctional, whatever. Was also exposed a little bit to java and visual basic â€” basically oop, now i treat everything as an object. Then i discovered web dev and found out about javascript, and i never hated my life so much from that point on.

Presently, i aim to continuously upskill in web dev, and at the moment, i've been really enjoying learning and building web apps powered by the Laravel framework. Man, the documentation. It couldn't get any better than that, everything i need in one place. This is my last term in college (i hope so), and one of the requirements for completion is a capstone project, or what they say, the culmination of your love and hate relationship with programming.

Under-development capstone project ðŸ‘‰ a [human resource web-app](https://github.com/POWERLANE-TEAM/emplo-hrms/tree/staging) powered by laravel and livewire.
