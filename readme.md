Name is Carl Tabuso, a senior student at PUP Santa Rosa. Had a little background and basic knowledge on low-level languages such as C and C++ in high school. At the same time during SHS, was introduced to various programming paradigmgs: procedural, oop, functional, dysfunctional, whatever. Was also exposed a little bit to java netbeans and visual basic â€” oop.

Discovered web dev and presently aims to continuously upskill in it â€” backend development in particular. This is my last term in college (i hope so), and one of the requirements for completion is a capstone project, or what they say, the culmination of your love and hate relationship with programming.

Under-development capstone project ðŸ‘‰ a [human resource web-app](https://github.com/POWERLANE-TEAM/emplo-hrms/tree/staging) powered by laravel and livewire.
