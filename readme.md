#### About me

Hi, my name is Carl Tabuso. A senior student at PUP Santa Rosa, passionate about how the web works and looks forward to building some really cool stuff. Had a little background on low-level languages such as C and C++, not smart enough for them, I think.

Currently learning and developing stuff using Laravel.
